    "Imagine you are a mechanical engineer working for the search and rescue team in Addis Ababa. You are are in charge of building *Mini-Tron*, a robot that will navigate its way around a minefield. You want to make sure that Mini-Tron is as fast and agile as possible. Thus, **your goal is to minimize the total weight of the robot.** You are given a collection of robotic parts, each part belongs to one of *n* different categories. **Your robot must be built from one part from each category.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you can have 4 categories: wheels, batteries, processing unit, distance sensors. Thus your robot must contain 4 parts: a set of wheels, one battery, one processing unit, and one distance sensor. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are also given the weight and cost of each part. The parts are given as an array of $n$ lists. Each list will contain the parts of the category, represented as a tuple *(cost, weight)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a problem with 4 categories and 10 total parts (2 parts in the first category, 3 parts in the second category, 3 parts in the third category, and 2 parts in the fourth category), your input $p$ can look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[(5, 4), (3, 8)],\n",
    " [(1, 10), (9, 1), (7, 5)], \n",
    " [(5, 12), (10, 7), (12, 5)],\n",
    " [(20, 2), (12, 6)]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, you have a total of $s$ birr to spend on the robot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that take as input three arguments: $n$ the number of categories, $p$ the list of parts, and $s$ the budget in birr, and outputs the minimum possible weight of the robot. If there is no solution, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above input and a budget of $30$ birr, your function should return $25$.\n",

    "We have $ns$ states where for each state, we need $O(k_{max})$ time to calculate the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also tighten our upperbound. Consider the fact that there are only a certain, finite number of combinations of parts that we need to test. How many combinations are there? It will be the product of the number of parts in each category. If there is $k_i$ parts in category $i$, then the total number of combinations is $k_1 * k_2 ... * k_n$. This also means that there are at most this many possible, unique remaining budgets for our robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the number of states we  end up testing in our program will be the minimum of $ns$ and $n(k_1 * k_2 ... * k_n)$ because there are only so many values for the remaining budgets we will ever need to test. So an even better upperbound is min( $O(n s k_{max})$, $O(n (k_1 * k_2 ... * k_n) k_{max})$)\n"
